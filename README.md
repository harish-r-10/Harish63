## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing). It includes both training and testing data that can be used to train and evaluate machine learning models.

## Dependencies

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
  
## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

1.Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from the official Python website.
2.Install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:
pip install notebook
3.Install the necessary Python packages using the following command:
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
4.Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
5.Navigate to the project directory.
6.Open the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., house_price_prediction.ipynb) using the following command:
jupyter notebook house_price_prediction.ipynb
7.execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook to run the code and visualize the results.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/harish-r-10/Harish63.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd house-price-prediction
3. Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and view the results.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is stored in the 'data' directory. It includes two main files:

- `train.csv`: Contains the training data.
- `test.csv`: Contains the testing data.

## Training and Evaluation

- The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical data.
- Various regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are trained and evaluated using techniques like cross-validation and appropriate performance metrics.

## Configuration

- Modify the hyperparameters of the models to optimize performance.
- Experiment with different feature engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy
